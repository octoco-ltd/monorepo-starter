# Octoco Front-End Standard

### ReactJS Template with TypeScript

## Get Started

1. run `yarn install`
2. run `yarn start`
3. Ensure your IDE is configured for ESLint using the `eslintrc.json` file
4. run `yarn storybook` in root to run storybook on your localhost (default port: 6006)

### What is this repository for?

- The purpose of this repository is to document the general stack which Octoco would like to use when scaffolding new web projects.
- The goal is to provide guidelines to be followed in terms of frameworks, libraries and architectural standards
- This should serve as a guideline and is not intended to be completely prescriptive in terms of implementation
- There are times where specific projects may differ from this standard (e.g. auth implementations based on client)

### Current Features

- ESLint and Prettier for code styling and formatting

### What is the stack?

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the framework
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for state management
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for validation
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the language and strong typing
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for auth, nosql storage and analytics
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for styling
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) for routing
- [Toast](https://ireade.github.io/Toast.js/) for messages
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for the http client, with a custom base api service as implemented and reused by Octoco
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.

### Extras / Variations

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) as the framework where there is a need for server-side rendering, more static sites etc
- Calvin's Custom Regex Implementation for validation
- Material UI as one package for various functions (styling, forms, wizards, validation, notifications, prebuilt components)

### Contribution guidelines

- heinrich@octoco.ltd
- calvin@octoco.ltd
- christiaan@octoco.ltd
- james@octoco.ltd
- todd@octoco.ltd

### Future Iterations

- Scaffold a project in this repo as a working example
- Add commonly reused helper functions to that project
- Add detailed justification for tech decisions, explain why
- Get the latest BaseApiService from Calvin and put it here
- Start building custom 'Octoco Components' for reuse across projects e.g. standard file upload component
- Consider using Material UI as one package for various functions (styling, forms, wizards, validation, notifications, prebuilt components)
- Investigate creating our own custom hooks which leverage the current BaseApiService

### Other Cool Stuff

- [Mzansi Data](https://octoco.mzansidata.co.za) is a white label app octoco built using material ui
- [Infisical](https://infisical.com/) for management of environment variables
